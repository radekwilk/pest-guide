        conclusion: 'Addressing rat infestations and maintaining a clean, pest-free environment is critical for food safety. Proactive pest control measures, regular inspections, and strict adherence to sanitation practices are essential to prevent the health and safety risks associated with rats in a restaurant setting. Our goal as auditors it\'s to help stores to prevent pests issues.',
